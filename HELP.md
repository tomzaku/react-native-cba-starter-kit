# Let's make a app call FunApp

##It's will take so long, be patient 
Now they will install lib related react-native: redux, saga, react-navigation...

Copying base component
Copy index.js file
Copy App Delegate
Copy bin and Makefile

Will copy src folder 
App Delegate depend on your local Id for test on the fly for ios device

# copy bin(script) and make file


# Time for Run App

## It's also take long time. So be patient!

##This error cuz I've already run another app with same port. Therefor, just stop that task and run again.

#App ready. But this is not my purpose. Take your time to deep the module

If you refresh the app it will show you the module you wanna work on. In this case is 'story'. Let see
 
 I forgot you have to login first
 And now you can refresh the app
 Awesome right?

I will make another module call 'game'

Let's reload the screen now.
It's move to 'Game Screen'.
Let's edit theme

# You can move around your module to another app with the same architecture.

## By using : zkrn module copy <moduleName> <AppDistPath>
